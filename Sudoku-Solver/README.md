# Sudoku Solver

A sudoku puzzle solver written in Python as a programming 
project for CS 211 at the University of Oregon.

Implemented constraint propagation to apply naked and hiddle single techniques to solve simple puzzles. Then added a recursive
back-tracking/guess-and-check approach to solve even the most complex and difficult puzzles. Utilized object-oriented techniques,
classes/objects, and recursion. 

Used a model-view-controller (MVC) structure to 
attach a graphical display to the game.
